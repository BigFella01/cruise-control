# Project Title

Cruise Control

# Description

This project is a web application that provides bicycle rentals
for a hypothetical business based out of Pensacola, Florida. Users
are able to choose between three bikes, and rent them hourly or
daily. Payment form does not actually collect credit card information,
it is only there for form validation practice. Users are then able to
look up their rental with a confirmation number.

# Acknowledgements

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
  Used to create app. It is a very fast build tool that features
  HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  Used for global state management. I was looking for a
  way to persist state that could be accessed by the entire application.
  It made more sense than useContext.

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
  Supabase: Used for database. It was the first ORM I was
  introduced to. It also helped me understand relational database concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization (PostgreSQL).

- [React-Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/overview)
  Used for improved performance with making HTTP
  requests from the front end. React Query optimizes data fetching and
  caching, resulting in faster load times.

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
  Used for client-side routing. It makes it easier
  to define the pages of an application. I simply defined page components
  and assigned them to an endpoint.

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
  Used to style application. It allowed me to encapsulate
  styles with the JSX they correspond to.
